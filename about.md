Marcin is a software engineer specializing in web development. His first gig was in 2002 (a plain HTML site) and since then he has been involved in many projects and in various roles. From DevOps (server administration, deployment automatization) through programing backend (PHP, Python, Lua) and frontend (AngularJS, jQuery, vanilla JavaScript) services to system architecture.

Marcin is a proponent of OpenSource - both receiving and giving. His first encounters and contributions were to PLD Linux distribution where he was responsible for updating SPEC files for PHP.
